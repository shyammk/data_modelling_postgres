# Sparkify Data Setup

## Introduction

<p>This project is about analyzing the data on songs and user activity on the new music streaming app from Sparkify. The analytics team at Sparkify, is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.<br>The data engineers need to create a postgres database with tables specifically designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. We will be creating a database schema, defining fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into the tables in postgres, using Python and SQL.</p>

    
## Datasets

<p>**Songs Dataset**: The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.<br><br>**Log Dataset**: The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.</p>
