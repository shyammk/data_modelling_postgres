# Data Modelling with PostgreSQL

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

A data engineer has been tasked to create a Postgres database, with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The database schema needs to be created, fact and dimension tables for a star schema need to be defined and an ETL pipeline needs to be developed to transfer the data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
